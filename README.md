# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

In this repository, I present some projects regarding mahcine learning tehcniques used in public health data, high tech part data, Climate Model Simulation Crashes data and several others. I design, test, validate and implement the tehcnique using cross validation.

# Techniques
The folder includes some of the Statitistical Data mining tehcniques that I worked on during STAT 5474 class.

Logisitc regression, L-1 and L-2 regularization, Dimension reduction, Principal component regression, clustering, Random Forest, Assoicaiton rules, Outlier Detection, Page-Rank, Parametric Non-linear regeression,  Generalize Addiitve Models (GAM), Multivariate Addaptive Regression Splines, Project Pursuit Regression, Artificial Neural Network.
